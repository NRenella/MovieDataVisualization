# Movie Data Visualization
## Purpose
I have a passion for data and movies so I thought why not try to create a visual for some popular movies throughout the year.

The dashboard is interactable as you can highlight a time period to get the stats for all the movies released during that period.

The link to the data visualization dashboard can be found here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/noah.renella/viz/MovieVisual_17217677790510/DataDashboard?publish=yes)

You may also see a screenshot of the dashboard below.

## Tools
I used Python, Tableau, Excel, and Kaggle for this project.

Python was used for data cleaning and formating.

The Movie Data can be found here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

Tableau sas used for visualizing the data as seen above
