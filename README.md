# Movie Data Visualization
## Purpose
I have a passion for data and movies so I thought why not try to create a visual for some popular movies throughout the year.

The link to the data visualization dashboard can be found here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/t/ntrenella89e985a6f7/views/MovieVisual/DataDashboard?:origin=card_share_link&:embed=n)

The whole project can be found here: [Tableau Public](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/ntrenella89e985a6f7/workbooks/1736035?:origin=card_share_link)

## Tools
I used Python, Tableau, Excel, and Kaggle for this project.

Python was used for data cleaning and formating.

The Movie Data can be found here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)

Tableau sas used for visualizing the data as seen above
